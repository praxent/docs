### Git Flow Process
---

You can work directly on master. Workflow goes like this:

- git pull
- do some work
- git pull
- git commit
- git push

In order to keep commit history nice and clean, the last three steps in the workflow should be done in that order, and in immediate succssion. Try not to sit on commits - push them out as soon as they are made.

You can work in a feature branch as well. Check out git-extras for some nice commands to support the feature / refactor / bug workflows. Note you can install git-extras with homebrew.
